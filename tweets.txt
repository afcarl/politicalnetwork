DanaRohrabacher	@mn4az U advocate end frequent flier miles, dramatically increase parking fees, reduce production &amp; raise price of meat, just some GW goals
DanaRohrabacher	@SusanMaylone OK so tell me, U advocate extending unemployment benefits, do U oppose giving amnesty to illegal immigrants?
DanaRohrabacher	@tan123 Constituents have priority so if U live in my district &amp; make it 2 DC, U R likely 2 have opportunity 2 make Ur case directly to me
DanaRohrabacher	@CColose make a specific point &amp; we can chat here. Unfortunately, when I beg for specific disagreements all I usually get is name calling
DanaRohrabacher	@akornblatt I worked on many of RR’s diplomatic remarks, but also science &amp; economic issues. I was not best writer, but was fastest
DanaRohrabacher	@WPPJr at a time when big issue is extending unemployment Insurance is a much debated issue, legalizing illegal immigrants is ludicrous
DanaRohrabacher	@bwcorb true, thank for recognizing that. I’m going to bed now. goodnight.

DanaRohrabacher	@ademhen assuming something personally bad about others simply because they disagree reflects a closed mind or a lack of intelligence

DanaRohrabacher	@ademhen U obviously R referring to people who disagree with U. Too many think less of someone who comes to a different conclusion.
